# Welcome!

This is the website for the Brazilian Student Society for Aerospace Research and Development.

We are engineering students and researchers from Brazil who believe in _user freedom_, _open-source_, and the _maker culture_.
Here we want to contribute to aerospace-related projects, to develop better and democratic technology for the future.

## Our Mission

> Foster Free (Libre) and Open Source projects in the aerospace field,
> while creating a community of researchers, students, and anyone interested to contribute and share with those projects.

We are not limited to _software_ projects, but anything related to aerospace engineering, for example,
you can document the development of your CAD files for a drone, share it with the community,
get feedback, contribute to others' ideas, etc.

We want to be a more _maker_ community, so we encourage everyone to get hands-on,
as we believe that prototyping and testing is the _engineering_ way of going on.

You can check out our main ideas on our _[Creation Manifesto](/manifesto.pdf)_.

## Teams

We have 6 teams that work on specific subjects, they are:

- **Avionics & Computation Team**: avionics, analytics, UAV, computational tools, infrastructure, and more.
- **Fixed-Wing Team**: airplanes, gliders, and more.
- **LTA Team**: lighter than air aircraft (i.e. balloons, airships).
- **Rocket Team**: rocket science, technology, and engineering projects.
- **Rotorcraft Team**: helicopters, multi-rotors (drones), and more.
- **Spacecraft Team**: spaceplanes, space stations, satellites, and more.

## About Open Source and Free Software

There are two visions (and definition) about free and open-source software.

One is about the _freedom_ of the software, as quoted from the
[GNU Project website](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html):
> “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
> Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

The other, more permissive vision, is about the _pratical_ advantages of Open Source, as quoted from the
[Open Source Initiative website](https://opensource.org/docs/osd):
> Open source enables a development method for software that harnesses the power
> of distributed peer review and transparency of process.
> The promise of open source is higher quality, better reliability,
> greater flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.

We can accept both of the views. It's more democratic, and sometimes excluding those who we don't agree
can be a poor choice, especially when the parts have the same positive goal.

## I want to contribute!

Cool! As our projects are Open Source and Free (as in freedom), the contribution is the right spirit!

We use some tools to help out our community, _Git_ is one of them.
If you aren't familiar with _Git_ you should _really_ check out about it [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

We use Trello to make our projects public, you can check it out [here](https://trello.com/bssaero).

### I want to contribute to a specific project

As you can download and fork any repository of any project, just do it!

If you want that your changes go to a _bss-aero_ repository
you can make a Pull Request (PR) and we will analyze what you have brought to the table
(this isn't a big deal).

If you are already a member and have the right team permissions
you can develop with your team into the repository.

### I want to start a new open-source project

Noice! We encourage this! If you need any help, you can get in touch with us.
Starting a project can be a very personal thing in the beginning,
so take your time to know what you want to achieve and what is the scope of your project.

If you already have a defined idea of your project and want to start it on _bss-aero_,
we suggest checking out our Trello board.

### I have a project and want it to be fostered or want some help

We want to contribute!
You can check out our Trello boards
to see in what team your project can be more fitted,
and get in touch with us.

### I want to be part of it

And we want you! To be clear, if you contribute in any form to some _bss-aero_ project,
you already are part of it.
But as we cannot just make it fully open,
the best way to get in is to start contributing to some projects
or get your project fostered in _bss-aero_.
Then, after some time, you can be on our internal team.

## Contact

We're on GitHub as [bss-aero](https://github.com/bss-aero),
but you can get in touch with [Victor Santos](https://zuckberj.page) too.
