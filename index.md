## I want to contribute!

Cool! As our projects are Open Source, the contribution is the right spirit!
You can check out our main ideas on our _[Creation Manifesto](/manifesto.pdf)_.

### I want to contribute in a specific repository

As you can download and fork any repository, just do it!

If you want the changes you made goes to a `bss-aero` repository
you can make a Pull Request (PR) and we will analyze what you have brought to the table.

If you are a member and has the right permissions you can develop into the repository

### I want to start a new open-source project

Noice! We encourage this! If you need any help, you can get in touch with us.
Starting a project can be a very personal thing in the beginning,
so take your time to know what you want to achieve and what is the scope of your project.

If you already have a defined idea of your project and want to start it on `bss-aero`,
we suggest to check out Trello board [here](https://trello.com/bssaero), and get in touch.

### I have a repository and want it to be fostered

You can check out our Trello boards [here](https://trello.com/bssaero)
to see in what team your project can be more fitted and get in touch with us.

### I want to be part of it

And we want you!
And as we cannot just add anyone who asks because of permission security,
the best way to get in is to start contributing to some projects,
or get your project set in `bss-aero`.
Then, after some time, you can be on our team.
